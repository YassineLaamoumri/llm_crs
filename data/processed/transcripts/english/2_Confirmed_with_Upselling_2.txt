Agent: Okay brother, no problem. God willing, it will reach you within two to three business days. Delivery times will be from 9 am to 9 pm. Will that be suitable for you?
Customer: By God, in the evening it will be suitable, but in the morning I am not present.

Customer: Good, God willing.
Agent: Okay brother, I just needed another mobile number from you for contact.

Agent: Okay brother, no problem. Okay, but this number is always available with me.
Agent: Okay, no problem. Okay, would you like to pay by Tamara, or cash, or card, or via bank card?
Customer: No, I will cash.
Agent: You don't want to pay via Tamara in four installments without any interest?
Customer: By God, no. Cash is better.
Agent: Okay, no problem. You will have a warranty with you. This warranty is for seven days against manufacturing and shipping defects and before use.

Agent: Okay brother, it also appeared to me that you won a gift discount coupon for three units of rosemary oil. This is very suitable for hair growth and beard growth, okay? It improves blood circulation and stimulates hair growth and makes the hair, as I told you, more dense. The three units will be for 50 riyals instead of 120 riyals. So if we add it, the total price will be 215 riyals, including delivery and tax.
Agent: Okay?
Customer: No problem, God willing.

Customer: No, no, by God, may God reward you with goodness.
Agent: Okay brother, thank you very much for your time. Wishing you a happy day.
Customer: May God protect you.
Agent: Goodbye.
